# F_star_function

This repository contains the implementation of the function \(\mathcal{F}^{***}(\rho_{E, p}, s)\), a mathematical tool designed to study elliptic curves and their associated \(L\)-functions. The function \(\mathcal{F}^{***}(\rho_{E, p}, s)\) provides a novel approach to approximating the \(L\)-function \(L(E, s)\) of an elliptic curve \(E/\mathbb{Q}\) and exploring the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture.

## Purpose

The function \(\mathcal{F}^{***}(\rho_{E, p}, s)\) combines arithmetic, geometric, and analytic information about elliptic curves to approximate their \(L\)-functions. It is particularly useful for:
- Studying the BSD conjecture.
- Exploring the behavior of \(L(E, s)\) at critical points.
- Conducting numerical experiments in number theory.

## Installation

To use this function, you need to have [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) installed on your system. You can download SageMath from its official website or use it online via [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/).

## Acknowledgments
The development of this tool was inspired by the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and its connections to elliptic curves and L-functions.
Special thanks to the SageMath community for providing a powerful platform for mathematical computation.

## Usage

The function `F_star(E, s, max_p)` is defined as follows:

```python
def F_star(E, s, max_p):
    """
    Compute the function F***(\rho_{E, p}, s) for an elliptic curve E.

    Parameters:
    - E: Elliptic curve over Q.
    - s: Complex variable.
    - max_p: Maximum prime to consider in the sum.

    Returns:
    - The value of F***(\rho_{E, p}, s).
    """
    N = E.conductor()  # Conductor of the elliptic curve
    total = 0  # Initialize the sum

    # Iterate over primes up to max_p
    for p in primes(max_p):
        a_p = E.ap(p)  # Coefficient a_p of the L-function
        v_p = valuation(N, p)  # Valuation of p in the conductor N

        # Compute the term for the current prime p
        term = (-1)**v_p * (a_p / p**s + (a_p**2 - 2*p) / p**(2*s) + (a_p**3 - 3*a_p*p) / p**(3*s))
        total += term  # Add the term to the total

    return total
```
